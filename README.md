# Cryptocurrencies
 
## Overview of Project
Stakeholders are interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, they have asked you to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. We will be using unsupervised machine learning and grouping the cryptocurrencies using a clustering algorithm. 

### Summary
We have completed this request using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm to reduce the dimensions of the data set. Next using the reduced data set we used the K-means algorithm to predict the K clusters for the cryptocurrencies' data. Lastly, we have created a 3D-Scatter, and a regular scatter visualization to show the different groupings of cryptocurrencies
